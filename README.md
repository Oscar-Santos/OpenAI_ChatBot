# OPENAI CHATBOT APP

## Overview ðŸŸ£
Brand Craft Pro Robot App is a small, yet complete full-stack application. For this app,Â I utilized various technologies such as React, React libraries, CSS, Node packages, and a Node.js server with the Express framework to create a web server.

The highlight of this application is an interactive chatbot that leverages the powerful "Text-DaVinci-oo3" model from OpenAI. Through API calls, the chatbot engages in conversations with users, simulating interactions with a real person. To ensure security, I have implemented the Dotenv module to load environment variables and conceal my API key, as OpenAI prioritizes data protection.

You can ask this chatbot for name suggestions, logo designs, or even an "about us" story for any type of business. It provides prompt-based responses, generating creative and relevant suggestions based on the input. Additionally, I have incorporated AI voice to deliver an introductory and thank-you message to the user.

Developing this application has been exciting but also challenging. I thoroughly enjoyed working on it and overcoming the various complexities that arose along the way.

## To set up this app locally, please follow these steps:ðŸŸ£

- Clone this repository using `git clone`. 
- Navigate to the root directory by running `cd brandCraftPro_robotApp`.
- Open two terminals simultaneously for the `brandCraftPro_robotApp`.
- In the first terminal, run `npm start`.
- After running 'npm start', if you encounter this error:

- Then ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can check this by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
  </br>
  `node -v`
  </br>
  `npm -v`

- If these commands return the version numbers, it means Node.js and npm are installed. If not, you will need to install them from the official Node.js website [Node](https://nodejs.org).
  
- After this, run the following command in your terminal `npm install` :
- Once this installation is complete, run `npm start` in your first terminal.
- Now in your second terminal, run: `node index.js`
- Then you would have the App running from the Front-End, and from the Back-End, and ready to use it.
- However if you ask a question to the chatbot and the terminal gives you this error:

- Then, it means that you need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Don't worry, getting one for free is easy.

## Obtaining an API key from OpenAI Chatgpt:ðŸŸ£

- To log in to your OpenAI account, please visit the [OpenAI site](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), If you don't have an account, you will need to create one.
- Once you login, go to `API`
- Go to `Personal` and click on `View API Keys`
- Then click on `+ Create new secret key`
- Now, copy your `API key` and your `Organization Key`

## Once you have obtained your OpenAI API key:ðŸŸ£

- Please return to the App and open your preferred editor (e.g., `VS Code`, `Atom`, etc.) from the brandCraftPro_robotApp directory.
- Open the `index.js` file.
- And paste your `OpenAI API key` and your `Organization key` into this line of code:

- Save the file, and now, once again, run `npm start` in one terminal, and in your second terminal, run `node index.js`.
- Now the App should be up and running!! Feel free to ask one of the three business-related questions to the App and see how it responds!!
