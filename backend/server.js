    Logo Description:
    The logo features a combination of Peruvian cultural elements and culinary symbols. It employs warm and vibrant colors to evoke a sense of energy and excitement. The logo consists of the following elements:
    
    1) Icon: A stylized representation of a traditional Peruvian chullo (knitted hat) with colorful patterns and tassels. This symbolizes the Peruvian heritage and adds a touch of authenticity to the logo.
    
    2) Typography: The restaurant name is displayed in bold, elegant lettering. Consider using a typeface that complements the cultural theme while maintaining readability. 
    
    3) Illustrations: Surrounding the chullo icon, small illustrations of Peruvian culinary items like a ceviche bowl, a pisco glass, or a quinoa plant can be incorporated. These elements represent the unique Peruvian food and drinks offered at your restaurant. 
    
    4) Color Palette: Utilize a vibrant color palette inspired by Peruvian textiles, such as deep reds, bright yellows, earthy browns, and vibrant greens. This creates an eye-catching and culturally rich visual appeal.
